# Real Estate Project
This project focuses on the economics side of real estate, answering potential questions about the real estate market and where prospective home buyers look for houses with their 
certain incomes and taxes. 

The report is seperated into different visualizations to see if whether not if the distributions of homes for sale are skewed toward the different parts of the United States, and whether or not states with large metropolitan cities are more expensive than states that are not.
